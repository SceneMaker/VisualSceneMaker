# MindBot ESM receiver

This VSM extension is part of the [MindBot project](https://www.mindbot.eu).

During the interaction with the workers, the avatar will ask to answer a few questions from the ESM (Experience Sampling Method) questionnaire.
This plugin is used to receive the answers of the worker and store them in a local Database, which will be later integrated in the overall centralized database of ESM collected during the whole study period.
